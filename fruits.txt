/*
guys stash is an easy idea. Your code is not ready to be committed yest,
 you stashed it away for a while (you pull updates) and later you pop your stash
 and keep developing

 after conflict warning messages:
 1. git stash save "message"
 2. git pull
 3. git stash pop
 4. git add .
 5. git commit -m "...."
 6. git push
